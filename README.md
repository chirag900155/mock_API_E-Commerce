# Mock API for E-Commerce

This repository contains mock APIs for an E-Commerce application. Please note that these APIs are for demonstration purposes only and do not provide real functionality.

Features
AccountSchema.js: This file defines the schema for user accounts, including details like username, email, and password.

CartSchema.js: Here, you'll find the schema to represent the user's shopping cart, which includes the products added by the user, quantities, and other relevant details.

ProductSchema.js: This file contains the schema to represent the products available in the E-Commerce store, including attributes like product name, description, price, and availability.
 
Routes
AllProduct.js: This route handles requests related to re trieving all available products in the E-Commerce store.
 
CartRoute.js: The CartRoute manages operations related to the user's shopping cart, such as adding products, updating quantities, and removing items. 

Login.js: This route allows users to log in, validating their credentials against the AccountSchema.

ProductRoute.js: The ProductRoute handles requests related to individual product details, including product information and availability.

Register.js: The Register route enables users to create new accounts, storing their details in the AccountSchema.

These mock APIs can be used as a starting point for testing frontend applications or understanding how an E-Commerce API might be structured. Keep in mind that these APIs do not have real database connections and are intended for development and learning purposes only.

Please feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for your E-Commerce development project. Happy coding! ðŸš€
